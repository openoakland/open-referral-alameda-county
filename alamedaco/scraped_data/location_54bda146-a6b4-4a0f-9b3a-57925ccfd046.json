The program serves Alameda, Contra Costa and Solano Counties. The goal of the Roads Home program is to provide Veteran families with housing stability through obtaining or maintaining permanent housing. Through this program, each household is assessed for eligibility and assistance is targeted to those who will benefit most from the program. Households are connected to mainstream resources and veteran resources, and may be offered financial assistance to obtain or sustain housing. Utilizing strength-based case management and motivational interviewing, program staff address critical barriers to housing, including but not limited to: low incomes, poor tenancy history, lack of access to benefits, and other legal issues. The overall goal of the program is to connect veterans to housing and supportive services that promote long-term housing and economic stability.There are two main models of assistance that are provided by the SSVF program:1. Rapid Re-housing - Rapid re-housing assistance is intended for eligible Veteran families who are literally homeless and may remain literally homeless but for SSVF assistance.2. Homelessness Prevention - Homelessness prevention assistance is intended for eligible Veteran families who are imminently at-risk of becoming literally homeless but for SSVF assistance."}
