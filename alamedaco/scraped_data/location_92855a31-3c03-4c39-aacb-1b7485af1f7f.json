They believe that alcoholism is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. There are no dues or fees for membership. Al-Anon is self-supporting through its own contributions. Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help families and friends of problem drinkers. Like AA, Al-Anon is an anonymous fellowship.Meetings are held every day and night at different locations.
