To find a training or volunteer opportunity in specific area go to website and enter zip code and select from the pull down menu. Following a major disaster, most relief organizations and emergency responder agencies are extremely busy, even if outside the affected area. The best time to sign-up to volunteer is during a non-disaster time. This allows time to train with a disaster relief organization to be ready when the next emergency strikes."}
