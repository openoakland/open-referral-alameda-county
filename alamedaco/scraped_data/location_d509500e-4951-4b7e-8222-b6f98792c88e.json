They believe that alcoholism is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. There are no dues or fees for membership. Al-Anon is self-supporting through its own contributions. Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help families and friends of problem drinkers. Like AA, Al-Anon is an anonymous fellowship.Meetings are held every day and night at different locations. Information and literature are provided at meetings. Please visit the website at www.alanontrivalley.org for more information about meetings locations and hours."}
