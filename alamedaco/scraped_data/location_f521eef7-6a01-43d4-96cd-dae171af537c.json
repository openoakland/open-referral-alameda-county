To participate in the program, applicants must be 60 years or older, homebound and frail with limited ability to obtain or prepare nutritious meals. Volunteers and staff deliver lunches and provide wellness checks on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, during the hours of 9am to 4pm. Meals are healthy, delicious and approved by a county registered dietitian and meet 1/3 of the required daily allowance for a senior.  BACS Meals on Wheels trains delivery staff and volunteers to be aware of signs of elder abuse and deterioration of functioning that place the senior at risk of institutionalization. BACS Meals on Wheels is operated by the Community Aging Services Program that also provide free lunches to seniors at various senior and community centers, limited care management services and Friendly Visitors services."}
