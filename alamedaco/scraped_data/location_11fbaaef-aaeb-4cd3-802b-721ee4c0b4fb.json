A mortgage restructure is not a refinance that requires eligibility for a new loan (i.e. high credit scores, high property values, etc). Since a restructure reduces either or both the interest rate and/or mortgage principal on the existing first mortgage, there are no mortgage criteria eligibility restrictions.If the homeowner is unemployed, NACA provides a forbearance with a minimum payment until they have steady income to have their mortgage restructured.The only homeowners not eligible are investors who own other properties. The sole exception to this requirement is when a homeowner who lives in the home they want to restructure and the occupants of a second property are immediate relatives and they can document that they are such relatives and they live in the property."}
