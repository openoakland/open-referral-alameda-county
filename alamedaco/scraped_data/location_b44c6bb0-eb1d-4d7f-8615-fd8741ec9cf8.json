Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), or autism, is a developmental disability considered to be the result of a neurological condition affecting normal brain function, development and social interactions. Children and adults with autism find it difficult or impossible to relate to other people in a meaningful way and may show restrictive and/or repetitive patterns of behavior or body movements. This program provides  interventions from birth to 3 years for those who may have autism. Services may include home-based services, structured play groups, parent education, community-based services, and consultation."}
