The ACA expands coverage and improves affordability in California by allowing the state to increase coverage of services, expand eligibility for the Medi-Cal program, and establish a health insurance marketplace that gives California residents greater ability to choose the health care plan that best suits their needs and preferences.UPDATE: U.S. citizens must provide acceptable original documentation of U.S. citizenship and identity on a one-time basis when applying for or renewing Medi-Cal benefits.
