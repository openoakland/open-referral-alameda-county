Teaches self-reliance skills and helps neighborhoods establish response teams to take care of the neighborhood until professional emergency personnel arrive. The underlying premise is that a major disaster will overwhelm first responders, leaving many citizens on their own for the first 72 hours or longer after the emergency.In addition to teaching the basic emergency preparedness and response curriculum, instructors adapt the curriculum to the special needs of the elderly or disabled; residents of apartments, condominiums and co-housing complexes; and public or private sector employees."}
