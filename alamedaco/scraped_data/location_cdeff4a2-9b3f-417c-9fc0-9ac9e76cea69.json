The City of Berkeley Planning and Development Department accomplishes this through obtaining compliance with the Berkeley Housing Code; goal is to provide safe and decent rental housing in the City of Berkeley.There are two basic components to the Housing Code Enforcement Section:1. The Rental Housing Safety Program (RHSP) is a program in which owners certify that the rental units they own meet certain basic safety standards yearly by utilizing a City developed safety inspection checklist. The City also randomly conducts pro-active inspections of rental units to ensure they are in compliance with the Berkeley Housing Code. 2. The Complaint-Generated Housing Inspection Program offers inspections on rental apartment buildings and units initiated by complaints from Berkeley tenants or by an other City department. Responds by notifying the property owner by mail and inspections usually take place in approximately 10 working days after communication with property owner and tenant. Shorter response times may be arranged based on the seriousness of the complaint and staffing availability. For additional information or to talk directly with one of the Inspectors, please call between the hours of 8-9am and 4-4:30pm."}
