A debtor is then required to establish a plan to repay creditors, or to liquidate their property. In  liquidation cases where no dispute is involved, the debtor is no longer be personally liable for repaying the debts.In other case where disputes are involved, there may be discovery, pretrial proceedings, settlement efforts, and a trial."}
