Focuses on helping people prevent, overcome or successfully adjust to difficulties while still accomplishing important things, rather than on helping people who are in the middle of life and death emergencies. People in a crisis or an emergency should call 911, ask a responsible relative or a friend to go with them to the hospital, or call a suicide hotline depending upon their situation.Activities include facilitated groups, computer classes, art classes and book discussion groups on topics such as ways to heal psychological and physical problems. Facilitated focus groups address a range of topics including various mental health and physical problems, divorces, family problems, job problems, job searches, deaths of relatives and friends, depressions, hospitalizations, anxieties, and ways to find meaning and purpose in life.While the staff includes a nurse, a minister, and others with college degrees, the focus is on people who have themselves struggled through challenging situations. People are encouraged to work with their doctors and licensed counselors. While the organization is not part of any church, people of all spiritual paths are respected."}
