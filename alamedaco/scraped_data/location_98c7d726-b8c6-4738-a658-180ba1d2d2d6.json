Contact Captain Scott Wyatt to start or join a Neighborhood Watch group by phone or by sending an e-mail to swyatt@ci.piedmont.ca.us. By cooperating with neighbors and the Piedmont Police Department, fight crime before it begins.Participants in the Volunteers in Public Safety (VIPS) program are adult men and women who are residents or business persons of Piedmont. They assist the sworn officers by performing duties such as vacation home checks, alarm enforcement, park patrol, interpreting, etc. These volunteers are key members of the department and contribute to the safety of the Piedmont community. Vacation Home Check is a service offered to residents who are away from their homes for a period of 4 to 30 days. If requested, Volunteers in Public Safety (VIPS) may periodically check the security of your house. If a problem is discovered, volunteers are within a radio call of a police officer who will respond and handle the situation."}
