The mission of the program is to provide lump-sum compensation and health benefits to eligible Department of Energy nuclear weapons workers, who contracted certain illnesses as a result of exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals (including employees, former employees, contractors and subcontractors) and lump-sum compensation to certain survivors if the worker is deceased. When you apply for either Part B and/or Part E they will collect medical, employment, and other information from you and make a decision about whether or not you qualify for compensation and benefits.For additional information about the EEOICPA or to schedule an appointment for claim-filing assistance, contact the California Resource Center toll-free at 866-606-6302 or visit the DEEOIC's website at www.dol.gov/owcp/energy."}
