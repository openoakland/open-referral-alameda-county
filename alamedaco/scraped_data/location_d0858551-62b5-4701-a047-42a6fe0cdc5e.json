Inspections are also required prior to connecting to, or the hook-up of: gas lines; electrical service; and/or water and sewer services. The inspections are required to insure that the construction is proceeding according to the approved plans and project conditions-of-approval, and that all current code standards are being met. This will help to insure personal safety and to secure the value of the improvement. It is your responsibility to schedule all inspections. An appointment must be made at least one working day in advance. During busy construction months, you may have to schedule several days in advance. Periodic inspections must be scheduled until the project is completed and the City gives final approval. After the job has received a final inspection, the building permit will be kept on file in the Building Services Department as proof of the work completed."}
