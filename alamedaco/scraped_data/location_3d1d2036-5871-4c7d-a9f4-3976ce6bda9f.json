CERT skills also apply to daily emergencies. Following a major disaster, people will have to rely on each other for help in order to meet immediate life saving and life sustaining needs until professional services arrive. Course skills will enable participants to provide emergency assistance to families and neighbors as well as organize a neighborhood team response in the event of a major disaster. There will be no charge for the course or materials. The only cost incurred may be in upgrading your disaster supply kit at home (food, water, tools etc.). The course is scheduled once a week for five consecutive weeks. Space is limited and class fills rapidly. Must attend all classes in order to receive certification. CERT training is free for all Hayward and Fairview residents."}
