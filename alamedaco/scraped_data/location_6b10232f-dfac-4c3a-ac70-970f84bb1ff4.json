Most consumers are unaware that repairs on vehicles could be accident substandard or may not have received parts and repairs paid for. Because most collision repair deficiencies are hidden and cannot be seen from the outside of a vehicle, deficiencies remain undetected. Potentially this puts vehicles at risk for future accidents. After calling to make an appointment, a BAR inspector will come to the consumers' home or office to inspect vehicle.HERCULES OFFICE serves Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Livermore, Oakland, Pleasanton.SAN JOSE OFFICE serves Fremont, Newark, Union City, part of San Leandro.SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE serves Castro Valley, Hayward, part of San Leandro, San Lorenzo."}
