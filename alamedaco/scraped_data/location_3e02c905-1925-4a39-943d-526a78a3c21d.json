The Art Director has a broad range of artistic experiences and will work with students one on one to develop a personal project and to expose youth to many different forms of art. Students learned how to make puppets from shoe boxes and developed personalities for each one. The puppets can now be seen in coffee shops around Oakland and Emeryville."}
