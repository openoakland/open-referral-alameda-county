Therefore, it is imperative that the police department and the community become proactive in securing businesses and neighborhoods through communication and collaboration.Neighborhood Crime Watch (NCW) is a partnership between residents and law enforcement to improve safety and prevent crime. NCW helps residents to learn who their neighbors are and how to work with them; how to use a neighborhood map and roster to communicate; how and why crime happens; how to improve home security and personal safety; how to recognize and report suspicious activity. Active NCW groups with visible NCW signs can deter crime."}
