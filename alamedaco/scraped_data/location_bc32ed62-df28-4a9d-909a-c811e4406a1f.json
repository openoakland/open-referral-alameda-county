The specially-trained CA conveys messages between the two parties.Anyone can initiate calls by simply dialing 711, and giving the CA the telephone number of the person they wish to call. CRS is available in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All operator services, including directory assistance, are available through CRS.When callers dial 711 their call is automatically routed to one of the CRS providers. By filing a 711 Choice Form, callers ensure that their call always will be routed to the relay provider of their choice. The provider also will answer the call in their preferred language and mode of communication. Once they establish their 711 Choice, their information is shared with both providers. They do not need to provide their information again.For AT&T Relay Customer Service 866-934-4288 (English) and 866-985-4288 (Spanish).For Hamilton Relay Customer Service 877-632-9095 (English) and 877-419-8440 (Spanish).For more information, please visit www.ddtp.org and select \"Relay Calls\" from the menu."}
