Their Reassurance phone friends place 5-10 minute calls from their homes, offices, or cell phones at a mutually agreed upon time.These phone calls:•  let the client know that someone cares.•  offer a few minutes of friendly conversation and compassionate listening.•  allow us to make sure the client is in reasonably good health.•  give us an opportunity to identify the need for information, referrals, and advocacy.Staff members provide a “safety net” by following up on unanswered calls to see if the client needs immediate help due to a fall, sudden illness, or other reason."}
