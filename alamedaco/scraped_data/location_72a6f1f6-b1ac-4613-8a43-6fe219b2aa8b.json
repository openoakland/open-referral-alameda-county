Open Resource is not an assessment, and no AT recommendations are made - but it is a way of seeing some possibilities, a place to begin the exploration of assistive technology solutions. An AT assessment is a comprehensive review of a student's assistive technology needs and how assistive technology (and computer use) fits into the student's educational plan."}
