Also provide advice, information and referral over the phone to tenants. While members are quite familiar with Oakland and state housing laws, they will refer tenants to legal resources when complex and specific legal questions are raised by tenants.  Work with other community resources in coordinating appropriate referrals when people need housing related assistance."}
