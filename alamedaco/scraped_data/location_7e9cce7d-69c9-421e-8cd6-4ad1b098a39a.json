The program was once the Thrift Store at the Church site and today, the program's focus is on those families who cannot afford even the thrift store prices for the most basic clothing needs.To ensure the clothing program is able to be sustainable and offer items such as donated clothing and small household items at no cost to the client, the program is primarily staffed through volunteers within the community. To inquire about donations or to volunteer please call 510-347-4620, EXT 119. Clothing program hours are 11-4; call ahead to ensure program is open."}
