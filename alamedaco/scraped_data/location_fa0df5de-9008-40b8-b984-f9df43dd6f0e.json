Women too often are late to test, diagnose, and treat, therefore women’s health outcomes are much worse than they could be. Focusing both on individual and community-level risks for HIV, Oakland WOW! aims to remedy that situation with targeted engagement for any self-identified woman at risk within our reach. Oakland WOW! leverages WORLD’s relationships with allied service providers to offer gender-responsive and culturally sensitive screening and prevention services for women with demonstrated vulnerability to HIV infection.
