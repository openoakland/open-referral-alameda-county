They meet both while they are in the hospital and after they are discharged, to discourage them, their family and friends from responding with violence and, instead, assist them in turning toward a more positive, healthy life by staying in school, accessing local resources and planning for the future. Intervention Specialists provide similar services to young people referred from the Castlement Health Center and the Juvenile Justice Center."}
