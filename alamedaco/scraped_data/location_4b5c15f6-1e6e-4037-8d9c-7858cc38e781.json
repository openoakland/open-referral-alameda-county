Beginning at age 16, every 6 months a Child Welfare Worker can request a TLC and invite anyone who is a part of the youth's life and who they feel is important to attend. They will discuss what the youth's emancipation goals are and how all parties, including B:E, can assist the youth in making a smooth and successful transition into adulthood. Beyond Emancipation works with county Child Welfare Workers to schedule and coordinate the conferences."}
