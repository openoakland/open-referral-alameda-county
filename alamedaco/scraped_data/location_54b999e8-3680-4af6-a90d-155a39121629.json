The California tax form starts with the federal adjusted income and then provides adjustments between federal and state tax laws.BUSINESS TAX: Corporations and businesses file more than 1 million returns each year, generating more than $10.4 billion annually. They pay a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business in the state. The corporation income tax is imposed on businesses that, while not doing business in this state, receive income from sources in this state. Combined, the tax programs comprise 64 percent of the stateâ€™s general fund. California follows the unitary method of taxation for businesses that receive income from both within and outside of California. NON-TAX COLLECTIONS: In addition to income tax liabilities, the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) pursues debts owed to state and local governments. As authorized by governing legislation, FTB provides collection services to collect on delinquent Vehicle Registration, Court-Ordered Debt, and Fines imposed for labor law violations."}
