The Friendly Visitor Coordinator meets with each of the seniors in their own home before starting the program.  At this time, the senior informs the staff member about their life and the things that they enjoy doing. The Coordinator also meets each of the volunteers and discusses their hobbies and activities. The Coordinator then matches a senior with a volunteer based on similar interests.  All volunteers receive a background check and training before starting the program."}
