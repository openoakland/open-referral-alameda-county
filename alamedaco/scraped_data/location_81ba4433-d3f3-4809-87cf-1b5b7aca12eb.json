SCHOOL-BASED THERAPY provides early intervention to children and youth in an accessible location. One such program, Safe Passages, targets middle-school students at school with high rates of expulsion for violence and high levels of truancy. Working with identified youth in these high-risk categories before they are involved with the juvenile justice or social services system allows opportunity to prevent family disruption. DAY TREATMENT REHABILITATIVE CLASSROOMS are provided collaboratively with both Mount Diablo and Oakland Unified School Districts. Fred Finch Youth Center provides two mental health staff to each of several classrooms at elementary, junior high and high school levels providing on-site day treatment services to youth with serious mental health issues that compromise their learning. Currently serves youth attending Westlake Middle School, Montera Middle School, Oakland High School or Skyline High School. Psychiatric services are available."}
