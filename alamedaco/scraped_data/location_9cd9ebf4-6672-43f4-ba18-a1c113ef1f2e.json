People that have been diagnosed with TB (or think they may have TB) need to see a doctor. TB Control can help persons with active TB disease and close contacts get medical care and complete treatment. For a doctor or clinic referral, call the Public Health Clearinghouse at 1-888-604-INFO, or email them at phclearing@acgov.org. If an individual does not have health insurance, there are clinics that will provide TB care at a reduced rate or no cost. Persons with TB infection or active TB may be eligible for Medi-Cal TB."}
