Program is emancipation-focused, preparing youth for self-sustained, autonomous living by helping them acquire the skills and competency needed to make independent and informed plans for their future.Milieu model involves a supervisor and masters level social worker leading the treatment team on-site in the home. The social worker's on-site presence creates the opportunity for treatment to become a seamless part of the culture rather than a separate function that happens off-site. Program approach originates from research demonstrating the lack of preparation foster youth have upon emancipating from the system, and from research identifying methods that appear to be effective in supporting foster youthsâ€™ successful transition to independent living. Provides guidelines for youth and staff to establish and meet specific independent living goals and develop a sound emancipation plan."}
