Offers safe space for LGBTQ youth to explore their identities, socialize, build community, develop leadership skills, and receive non-stigmatizing, culturally competent mental health services. Our Space activities include movie night, support groups, art groups, participation in local LGBTQ events and more.Our Space recognizes that LGBTQ homeless youth and youth in out-of home care often slip through the cracks in the service delivery of mainstream LGBTQ organizations due to lack of awareness regarding the unique needs of these populations. Our Space holds the needs and the strengths of these youth as primary and provides real opportunities for non-traditional youth leaders to create change in their communities and beyond. Our Space draws on best practice recommendations for working with LGBTQ youth to support the growth and progress of those they serve."}
