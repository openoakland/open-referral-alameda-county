Structured curriculum includes all the media and activities of the Day Program. Classes are small so that each student receives individual attention. Students experience the excitement of discovering their creative potential and the reward of having their artwork exhibited and sold in the Creative Growth Art Center Gallery. This program serves as a bridge from school to adult activities."}
