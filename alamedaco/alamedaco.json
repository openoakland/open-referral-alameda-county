It often occurs in outbreak form and is sometimes referred to as “stomach flu” (although the terms “flu” or \"influenza\" should really be restricted to a respiratory infection). Outbreaks are linked to food handled by infected individuals, by person-to-person contact (especially in day care centers and nursing homes/custodial institutions), and from eating raw shellfish (especially oysters and clams grown in sewage-contaminated waters).HOW PEOPLE GET INFECTED WITH NOROVIRUS: People get a Norovirus infection: (1) directly from an ill individual who did not wash his hands adequately; (2) indirectly from food or water contaminated by the stool or vomit from an infected person; or (3) from airborne particles produced by those vomiting.SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF NOROVIRUS: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, low grade fever or no fever at all. Symptoms usually appear one to two days after exposure.TREATMENT AND RECOVERY: No specific treatment is available. Infected persons usually recover fully in 1-3 days, but illness may be severe in elderly persons who may require hospitalization. Persons who are severely dehydrated might need fluid and electrolyte therapy.PREVENTION OF NOROVIRUS: (1) Wash hands with soap and warm water after toilet visits and before preparing or eating food; (2)  people with symptoms of Norwalk-like illness should not prepare food or provide patient care; (3) cook all shellfish thoroughly before eating; (4) wash raw vegetables before eating.CARE PROVIDERS: Custodial institutions need to assure a high level of personal hygiene to avoid person-to-person spread. Caretakers need to increase frequency of hand washing, especially before and after patient care.","short_desc":"Provides information on Norovirus, also known as stomach flu.

Provides temporary financial assistance in the form of a mortgage payment subsidy of varying size and term to unemployed homeowners who wish to remain in their homes but are in imminent danger of foreclosure due to short-term financial problems. These funds can provide up to six months of benefits with a monthly payment of up to $3,000 or 100% of the existing total monthly mortgage, whichever is less.MORTGAGE REINSTATEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (MRAP) – Intended to assist homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments due to a temporary change in a household circumstance. MRAP will provide limited financial assistance in the form of funds to reinstate mortgage loans that are in arrears in order to prevent potential foreclosures. These funds can provide benefits of up to $15,000 per household.PRINCIPAL REDUCTION PROGRAM (PRP) – Intended to assist homeowners at risk of default because of an economic hardship coupled with a severe decline in the home’s value. PRP will provide capital to reduce outstanding principal balances of qualifying borrowers with negative equity. Principal balances will be reduced in an effort to prevent avoidable foreclosures and promote sustainable homeownership. The principal reduction program will most likely be a prelude to loan modification. (Servicers that contribute through matching funds increase the benefit for homeowners.)TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP) – Intended to promote community stabilization by providing homeowners with relocation assistance when it is determined that they can no longer afford their home. TAP will be used in conjunction with a servicer-approved short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure program in order to help homeowners transition into stable and affordable housing. Homeowners will be responsible to occupy and maintain the property until the home is sold or returned to the servicer as negotiated.

Coordinates recovery assistance with federal, state, local, and voluntary/nonprofit entities. The Individual Assistance recovery process involves the following:EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE through voluntary agencies, such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army, can include emergency housing in the form of shelters or hotel vouchers, food, or clothing during any significant emergency. Contact local voluntary agency. INSURANCE: Individuals should contact their insurance company to report their loss. Ask insurance agent or representative to help with the claim. For assistance with insurance issues, contact the California Department of Insurance at 1-800-927-HELP (4357) or by visiting their website. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS: Governor may determine recovery is beyond the resources of state and local governments and can request federal assistance by seeking a Presidential Declaration. Declaration initiates Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance process through its Individuals and Household Program (IHP). This includes \"Housing Needs\"  (temporary housing, repair, replacement, construction) and \"Other than Housing Needs\" (see website for inclusions).STATE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT PROGRAM (SSGP): Administered by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS), provides grant funds to assist people who have suffered damage in a disaster area declared by the President, and when FEMA's IHP is implemented. There is no separate application process, as FEMA will refer applications to CDSS when the maximum assistance from FEMA's IHP has been reached. As with the FEMA IHP, SSGP cannot duplicate assistance from any governmental agency or personal insurance.UNMET NEEDS: Once a disaster survivor has exhausted all other assistance programs, voluntary agencies may implement programs to assist people with necessary remaining unmet needs. Local Long Term Recovery Committees may be formed within a disaster area to coordinate resources for recovery. Additionally, Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (VOADS) may be able to assist individuals and families with their recovery efforts.
