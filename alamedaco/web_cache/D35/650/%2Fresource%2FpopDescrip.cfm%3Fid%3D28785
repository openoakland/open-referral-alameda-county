Programs that are responsible for establishing an orderly process for evaluating and approving any of a wide range of land development projects, many of which involve modifications in the current or permitted use of property within a jurisdiction. They also provide information and other forms of support for developers who submit applications and may be in various stages of the approval process; establish mechanisms for community input on proposed development; and ensure access to an appeals process for individuals who are dissatisfied with land development decisions. Development proposals are evaluated in accordance with criteria established by the jurisdictionâ€™s zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations and other applicable ordinances as well as the broader policies set forth the communityâ€™s general plan (also knows as a comprehensive, master or official plan) and relevant specific/area plans (sometimes called community, neighborhood or secondary plans).
