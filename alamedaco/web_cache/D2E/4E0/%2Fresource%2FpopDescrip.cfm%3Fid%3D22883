Programs that provide a variety of services and activities that are intended to stimulate the economy; expand employment opportunities; encourage the establishment and growth of commerce and industry; improve the physical infrastructure through redevelopment; support the development, finance, management and preservation of affordable housing; and otherwise enhance the economic development of the community. Many programs focus on impoverished communities and are structured to prevent the outflow of community dollars and to retain and recycle income within the community by investing in the development of local institutions and businesses and thereby creating local jobs, sustaining local services and building a healthier local economy. Also included are the institutions that the financial sector comprises and the services they provide for businesses and the general public.
