Programs that are staffed by specialists who provide comprehensive preventive, diagnostic and treatment services for individuals who have diseases or injuries which affect the internal organs and require nonsurgical intervention. General internists provide continuing comprehensive care for common and complex multisystem illnesses in ambulatory care as well as hospital settings. Internists often function as primary care physicians who are the patient's initial point of contact with the health care system and who assume ongoing responsibility for maintaining the health of their patients and for providing treatment in case of illness including consultation with specialists when required.
