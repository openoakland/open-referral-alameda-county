<font size="+1"><strong>Disaster Relief Services</strong></font><br>
Programs that facilitate the exchange of information and/or provide short-term assistance, usually in the form of food, clothing, blankets, temporary shelter, furnishings, small appliances or temporary financial aid, for people who have suffered injuries or incurred losses due to a major disaster or large-scale emergency that disrupts the normal functioning of a community.  The objective of disaster relief is to help individuals sustain their lives during the immediate aftermath of the event.  NOTE: "Disaster Relief" is a category of services utilized by community human services agencies involved in disaster work.  Government organizations do not recognize disaster relief as a formal part of the disaster cycle.  Most of the services classified as disaster relief are considered by government to be part of disaster recovery and a few (e.g., disaster welfare inquiries) are categorized as disaster response.
