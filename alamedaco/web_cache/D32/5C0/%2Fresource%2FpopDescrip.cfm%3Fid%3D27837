Programs that provide information that improves the public's understanding of living and working conditions and other factors that safeguard their health and prevent or reduce the risk of injury, disease, disability and premature death. Health education programs help people make informed decisions about matters which affect their personal health and the health of others. They inform the public of health and safety hazards, help people modify behaviors that compromise their health, encourage people to take advantage of early detection programs and provide information about treatment and rehabilitation options for people who have an illness, injury or disability. They also provide anticipatory information or guidance to help people deal with and understand specific medical procedures, being hospitalized or other necessary interfaces with the health care system.
