Programs that provide assistance and support for individuals who are physically dependent on substances of any kind during the withdrawal period. Detoxification is a medical regimen aimed at managing acute intoxication and withdrawal by systematically reducing the amount of the addictive substance in a patientâ€™s body, providing reasonable control of active withdrawal symptoms and/or averting a life-threatening medical crisis related to the substance.
