Organizations that are actively seeking individuals with the requisite skills and experience who are willing to help the agency with any of a wide variety of special events (e.g., parties, dances, receptions, concerts, lecture series, arts fairs, charity golf tournaments or walkathons) on a voluntary basis without remuneration. Volunteers may be asked to greet, register and orient the event guests; collect payments; hand out programs; assist with crowd control, exhibit interactions, coat-check and behind-the-scenes operations; and take on other tasks to help ensure that the event runs smoothly.
