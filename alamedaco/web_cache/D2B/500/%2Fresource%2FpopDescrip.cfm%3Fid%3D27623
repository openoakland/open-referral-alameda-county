Programs that encourage the public to provide information, often anonymously, which might lead to the arrest, prosecution and conviction of people who have committed crimes. Included are special "tip" lines and crime reporting hotlines that have been established by law enforcement organizations, employers or community resources, but not law enforcement offices which take crime reports as a part of their everyday activities unless they have a special number for a particular type of report.
