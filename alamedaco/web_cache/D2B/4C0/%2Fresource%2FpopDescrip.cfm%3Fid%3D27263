Programs that provide information through a variety of channels that improves the public's understanding of mental health and mental illness; the nature, etiology, diagnosis and treatment or management of specific mental disorders; and strategies for reducing the incidence of problems where possible. Mental health education programs help people make informed decisions about matters that affect their personal mental health and that of others. They inform the public of the risk factors and signs of mental health problems, encourage people to take advantage of early detection programs, help people modify behaviors that compromise their own mental health and provide support for family members and friends who are coping with mental illness or other mental health issues that have affected a loved one.
