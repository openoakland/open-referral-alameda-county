<font size="+1"><strong>Social Insurance Programs</strong></font><br>
Programs that have been established by law and are generally compulsory in nature which provide cash income on a regular basis or payments to meet a designated need for people who are entitled to benefits based on their own or their employer's contributions to the program and their service to the country. Although there may be assessment procedures to confirm eligibility, there are no financial means or assets tests associated with these benefits.
